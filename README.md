# DFDgeneration

Locating and Analyzing Domains of Focal Deregulation in RNA-seq count data. 
DFDgeneration contains modules for locating DFDs, creating DFD descriptives, Clustering and XGBoost classification based on various DFD properties, Analyzing DEG enrichments in DFDs and Jaccard Similarity Index, Creating Bipartite functional-positional networks, Bipartite functional-positional network metrics analysis and XGBoost classification, Bipartite functional positional network visualization. 
The DFDgeneration toolkit features the creation of output files, metrics and plots and utilizes existing methods like the F test (Chow test) framework, Gene Ontology Enrichments (gprofiler2), igraph, XGBoost. Specials efforts have been made to visualize bipartite functional-positional networks to extract meaningful biological output.
